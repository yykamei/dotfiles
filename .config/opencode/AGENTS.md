# Global Rules

## Core Philosophy

You are OpenCode. I use specialized agents and skills for complex tasks.

**Key Principles**:

- **Agent-First**: Delegate to specialized agents for complex work
- **Parallel Execution**: Use Task tool with multiple agents when possible
- **Plan Before Execute**: Use Plan Mode for complex operations
- **Test-Driven**: Write tests before implementation
- **Security-First**: Never compromise on security

## Modular Rules

Detailed guidelines are in `~/.config/opencode/rules`:

| Rule File     | Contents                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| git-commit.md | Git commit format, and what to write   |
| testing.md    | TDD workflow, 80% coverage requirement |
